## Course Creation Form Bug: Missing Course Date Field

### Problem Description
When adding a new course through the form at `/local/annualplans/add_course.php`, the form only asks for "Duration (days)" and does **not** require or set a course date (`coursedate`).

### Impact
- The annual report block only displays courses where the `coursedate` field is a valid timestamp within the current year.
- If the course is created without a valid `coursedate`, it will **not appear** in the annual report, even if all other fields (approval, level, etc.) are correct.
- This leads to confusion, as users expect newly added courses to show up in the report but they do not.

### Root Cause
- The form collects "Duration (days)" (a number), but not the actual course date.
- The `coursedate` field in the database is left empty, invalid, or set to a default value that does not match the current year.

### Recommendation
- Update the course creation form to include a required course date field (date picker).
- Ensure the selected date is saved as a Unix timestamp in the `coursedate` field of the `local_annual_plan_course` table.
- This will ensure new courses are eligible to appear in the annual report for the correct year.

### Solution
### Solution Steps:

1. Update the form to use annualplans.id as the primary identifier
2. Remove reliance on coursedate/duration fields
3. Modify queries to join with annualplans table
4. Update display logic to show courses based on annualplans year

This will provide a more reliable way to track and display courses in the annual report, while maintaining consistency with the annualplans system.
