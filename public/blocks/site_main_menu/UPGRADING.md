# block_site_main_menu Upgrade notes

## 5.1

### Added

- The "Main menu" block has been renamed to "Additional activities." Its title is now customizable, and it can be used in course formats without a dedicated view page (for instance, Single activity). On the Home page, this block has also been renamed; administrators will need to manually revert the name if they wish to retain "Main menu" after upgrading.
