Feature: Create shared categories and fields
  In order to have shared custom fields
  As a manager
  I need to create, edit, remove and sort shared custom field's categories

  Scenario: Create and delete a category for shared custom fields
    Given I log in as "admin"
    When I navigate to "Custom fields > Shared custom fields" in site administration
    And I press "Add a new category"
    And I wait until the page is ready
    Then I should see "Other fields" in the "#customfield_catlist" "css_element"
    And I click on "[data-role='deletecategory']" "css_element"
    And I click on "Yes" "button" in the "Confirm" "dialogue"
    And I wait until the page is ready
    And I wait until "Other fields" "text" does not exist

  Scenario: Shared customfields are displayed in other entities
    Given the following "custom field categories" exist:
      | name               | component        | area   | itemid |
      | My shared category | core_customfield | shared | 0      |
    And the following "custom fields" exist:
      | name            | category           | type | shortname |
      | Shared field 1  | My shared category | text | f1        |
    And I log in as "admin"
    And I navigate to "Courses > Default settings > Course custom fields" in site administration
    Then I should see "My shared category" in the "#customfield_catlist" "css_element"
    And I should see "Shared field 1" in the "#customfield_catlist" "css_element"

    And I should see "My shared category" in the "#customfield_catlist" "css_element"
    And I should see "Shared field 1" in the "#customfield_catlist" "css_element"

    Given the following "custom field categories" exist:
      | name               | component        | area   | itemid |
      | My shared category | core_customfield | shared | 0      |

    # Check that the delete category link exists for course categories but not for shared categories.
    Then "Delete" "link" should exist in the ".//div[contains(@class, 'categoryinstance')][.//span[@data-value='My course category']]" "xpath_element"
    And "Delete" "link" should not exist in the ".//div[contains(@class,'categoryinstance')]/h3[normalize-space(text())='My shared category']" "xpath_element"
    # Check that the inplaceeditable exists for course categories but not for shared categories.
    And "//div[contains(@class,'categoryinstance') and contains(.,'My course category') and .//span[contains(@class,'inplaceeditable')]]" "xpath_element" should exist
    And "//div[contains(@class,'categoryinstance') and contains(.,'My shared category') and .//span[contains(@class,'inplaceeditable')]]" "xpath_element" should not exist
    # There should be no move button for lone custom field categories.
    And "Move \"My course category\"" "button" should not exist
    # There should be no move button for lone custom fields within a single custom field category.
    And "Move \"Course field 1\"" "button" should not exist
    And I press "Add a new category"
    # There should be no move button for shared categories and custom fields.
    And "Move \"My shared category\"" "button" should not exist
    And "Move \"Shared field 1\"" "button" should not exist
    # TODO. We should not need to reload the page, but behat fails to find the move buttons otherwise.
    And I reload the page
    # With more than one category there should be move buttons for course categories and fields.
    And "Move \"My course category\"" "button" should exist
