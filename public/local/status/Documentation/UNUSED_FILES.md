  - **Recommendation**: Keep for troubleshooting purposes

### üìñ Documentation Files

These files provide documentation and historical information:

#### Current Documentation
- **`README.md`** - Main plugin documentation
  - **Status**: Actively maintained, useful for developers
  - **Recommendation**: Keep and maintain

#### Legacy Documentation
- **`WORKFLOW_SEPARATION_SUMMARY.md`** - Historical workflow separation changes
  - **Status**: Historical documentation of past refactoring
  - **Recommendation**: Keep for historical reference, but consider archiving

- **`WORKFLOW_RENAMING_SUMMARY.md`** - Historical renaming documentation
  - **Status**: Historical documentation of class renaming
  - **Recommendation**: Keep for historical reference, but consider archiving

#### Feature Documentation
- **`DYNAMIC_APPROVER_README.md`** - Dynamic approver system documentation
  - **Status**: Current feature documentation
  - **Recommendation**: Keep and maintain

- **`DEPARTMENT_CAPABILITIES.md`** - Department structure documentation
  - **Status**: Current system documentation
  - **Recommendation**: Keep and maintain

### ü§î Potentially Unused or Low-Usage Files

#### Action Handlers (Referenced but not directly visible)
- **`pages/actions/workflow_actions.php`** - Workflow CRUD operations
  - **Status**: Likely exists but not directly listed in file structure
  - **Usage**: Handles form submissions from workflow management interface
  - **Recommendation**: Essential for functionality, keep

- **`pages/actions/step_actions.php`** - Step management operations
  - **Status**: Likely exists but not directly listed in file structure
  - **Usage**: Handles form submissions from step management interface
  - **Recommendation**: Essential for functionality, keep

## Usage Analysis by Category

### High-Usage Files (Used on every request)
1. **`classes/status_workflow_manager.php`** - Called on every status transition
2. **`lib.php`** - Permission checking function used frequently by other plugins
3. **Language files** - Loaded for every admin interface access
4. **`settings.php`** - Referenced by Moodle admin system

### Medium-Usage Files (Used in admin interface)
1. **`pages/dashboard.php`** - Used when accessing workflow dashboard
2. **`classes/workflow_dashboard_manager.php`** - Used for admin operations
3. **Renderer files** - Used for displaying workflow and step tables
4. **Form files** - Used when creating/editing workflows and steps
5. **`styles.css`** - Loaded with admin interface

### Low-Usage Files (Installation/Upgrade only)
1. **`db/install.php`** - Only used during plugin installation
2. **`db/upgrade.php`** - Only used during plugin upgrades
3. **`db/install.xml`** - Only used during installation/upgrades

### Diagnostic/Development Files (Manual use only)
1. **`diagnostic_workflow.php`** - Only used for troubleshooting
2. **Documentation files** - Only used by developers/administrators

## File Retention Recommendations

### ‚úÖ Keep - Essential Files
All files in the following categories should be retained:
- Core plugin infrastructure
- Database layer files
- Core classes
- User interface files
- Language files

### ‚úÖ Keep - Useful for Development
- **`diagnostic_workflow.php`** - Valuable for troubleshooting
- **Current feature documentation** (DYNAMIC_APPROVER_README.md, DEPARTMENT_CAPABILITIES.md)
- **Main README.md** - Essential for developers

### üìÅ Consider Archiving - Historical Documentation
These files contain valuable historical information but may not need to be in the main plugin directory:

- **`WORKFLOW_SEPARATION_SUMMARY.md`** - Move to Documentation/Archive/
- **`WORKFLOW_RENAMING_SUMMARY.md`** - Move to Documentation/Archive/

**Rationale**: These files document past changes that are now complete. While historically valuable, they don't need to be prominently displayed.

### ‚ùå No Files Identified for Deletion
Analysis shows that all files in the plugin serve a purpose:
- Core files are essential for operation
- Diagnostic files are valuable for troubleshooting
- Documentation files provide important information

## Hidden/Missing Files Analysis

Based on code references, these files likely exist but weren't directly listed:

### Action Handler Files
- **`pages/actions/workflow_actions.php`** - Referenced in index.php
- **`pages/actions/step_actions.php`** - Referenced in index.php

### Potential Template Files
- The plugin may have additional template files in an unlisted directory
- Check for `/templates/` directory with Mustache templates

## File Usage Monitoring

### High-Priority Monitoring
Monitor these files for performance impact:
1. **`classes/status_workflow_manager.php`** - Called frequently by other plugins
2. **`lib.php`** - Permission function called often
3. **Database query performance** in manager classes

### Development Monitoring
Track usage of these files for maintenance planning:
1. **`diagnostic_workflow.php`** - Usage indicates system issues
2. **Admin interface files** - Usage patterns indicate admin activity
3. **Documentation access** - Indicates developer engagement

## Cleanup Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Organize documentation** - Move historical docs to Archive subfolder
2. **Verify action handlers** - Ensure referenced files exist
3. **Review diagnostic output** - Run diagnostic script to check for issues

### Long-term Maintenance
1. **Archive old documentation** - Move completed change documentation to archive
2. **Monitor file usage** - Track which files are accessed frequently
3. **Update documentation** - Keep current feature docs up to date

## Summary

The Status Plugin has a well-organized file structure with no files that should be deleted. All files serve either:
- **Core functionality** (essential for operation)
- **Development/diagnostic purposes** (valuable for troubleshooting)
- **Documentation** (important for developers and administrators)

The main recommendation is to organize documentation better by moving historical documentation to an archive subfolder while keeping current feature documentation accessible.
