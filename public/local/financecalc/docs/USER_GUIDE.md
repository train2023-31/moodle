## Understanding Your Financial Data

### Data Sources

The Finance Calculator pulls data from two main sources:

#### 1. Finance Services
- **Budget**: Money allocated for finance services
- **Spending**: Approved finance service requests
- **Status**: Only approved requests (status 13) are included

#### 2. Participant Requests
- **Spending**: Approved participant compensation and costs
- **Calculation**: Uses either direct compensation or duration √ó cost rate
- **Status**: Only approved requests are included

### Reading the Numbers

#### Example Data Row:
```
Year: 2025
Spending: 53.00 OMR
Budget: 1,500.00 OMR
Balance: 1,447.00 OMR (green)
```

**What this means:**
- In 2025, you had a budget of 1,500 OMR
- You spent 53 OMR on approved requests
- You have 1,447 OMR remaining (positive balance)
- The green color indicates you're under budget

#### Negative Balance Example:
```
Year: 2024
Spending: 2,000.00 OMR
Budget: 1,500.00 OMR
Balance: -500.00 OMR (red)
```

**What this means:**
- In 2024, you had a budget of 1,500 OMR
- You spent 2,000 OMR on approved requests
- You exceeded your budget by 500 OMR
- The red color indicates you're over budget
