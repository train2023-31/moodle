notes:
  core_group:
    - message: >
        `groups_print_activity_menu()` and `groups_get_activity_group()` now
        include an additional `$participationonly` parameter, which is true by
        default. This can be set false when we want the user to be able to
        select a non-participation group within an activity, for example if a
        teacher wants to filter assignment submissions by non-participation
        groups. It should never be used when the menu is displayed to students,
        as this may allow them to participate using non-participation groups.
        Non-participation groups are labeled as such.
      type: improved
