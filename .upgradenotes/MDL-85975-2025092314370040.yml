    - message: >
        `restore_qtype_plugin::unset_excluded_fields` now returns the modified
        questiondata structure,

        in order to support structures that contain arrays.

        If your qtype plugin overrides
        `restore_qtype_plugin::remove_excluded_question_data` without

        calling the parent method, you may need to modify your overridden method
        to use the returned

        value.
      type: fixed
